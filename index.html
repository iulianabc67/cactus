             <p>Wait a minute, i said I wanted simple, but not boring. What is up with this design? There`s<br>
                nothing on it but while space and some text and a minimal picture. Thats`s not what I had in<br>
                mind. The tipe is all in Helvetica, which i like, but it doesen`t excite me at all. There is just no<br>
                character or anaything here. It has a minimal look, but is just too vanilla. I realy need<br>
                something to grabb the attention of a visitor to the side and just doesn`t do it.</p>
